- I am Tuyishime Eric, a passionate and innovative designer specializing in online television experiences. With a background in multimedia design and a keen interest in user experience, I strive to create engaging and visually appealing interfaces that enhance viewers' enjoyment and accessibility to content. My current project, Online TV Design, allows me to merge my creativity with the latest technology trends to deliver a seamless viewing experience.

In addition to my design expertise, I am a telecommunications trainee with a strong foundation in computer science. My experience spans telecommunication, programming, and electrical safety, providing a unique perspective on integrating technology with design.

I believe in the power of storytelling through design, focusing on the needs and preferences of users while ensuring functionality and aesthetic appeal. With a collaborative approach, I thrive in dynamic environments, leveraging feedback to refine and elevate my designs. My goal is to contribute to the evolution of digital media and redefine how audiences connect with their favorite shows and films.

Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of Rwanda, I am continually expanding my knowledge and skills. I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Django, and other technologies to bring innovative projects to life. I am also experienced in using Visual Studio, Git Bash, and Dev C++ for development, and I am proficient in creating multilingual websites.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am a creative individual who enjoys composing music, with many songs reflecting my personal experiences and emotions. My personal portfolio showcases not only my professional work but also my artistic side, featuring links to my YouTube channel and favorite music.
